CST3144 Coursework – Backend (Express.js + MongoDB Atlas + Node.js)

This repository contains the Express.js backend for the CST3144 Full Stack Web Application.
The server communicates with MongoDB Atlas using the native MongoDB Node.js driver , as required in the coursework specification.

The backend exposes a REST API that returns lessons, accepts orders, updates lesson spaces, and handles search requests.
